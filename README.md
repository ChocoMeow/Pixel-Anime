## üîß Configuration

### API Integration

Pixel Anime uses [Consumet API](https://api.consumet.org) as the data source for anime information and streaming sources. Consumet is a free, open-source API that provides:

- Comprehensive anime metadata
- Episode information
- Video streaming sources
- Search functionality
- Genre filtering

You'll need to configure the `.env` file with the API endpoints:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for Consumet API (default: https://api.consumet.org)
- `VITE_PROXY_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the CORS proxy (if needed for streaming)

Note: If you're deploying to production, consider setting up your own Consumet API instance to avoid rate limits.
